T: yo my man, I like the bare bone setup you've created. I changed up the Block.js file to Blockchain.js, and reorganized some things based off this video I was watching. They can each be their own class, but honestly I couldnt figure out how to make a class a protype of another class, so I declared it straight up with a custom constuctor. are you planning on building the hash functionality?
